# just your basic react login form

just your basic react login form for my react students.
notice that we're keeping track of whether someone is logged in our not in our main app.
i'll convert this to use redux in another repo/video.
also notice how the project is broken up into pages and components!
this is one pretty common pattern for putting together react apps.
let me know if you have any questions.
feel free to fork this repo and/or use it in your own app!

npm install
npm start to check it out.
